* Description: In this file - in the function TimeStep() - the various 
* numerical solvers of the first programming assignment have to be
* implemented. Feel free to add new local functions into this file. 
* Changes to other source files of the framework should not be 
* required. It is acceptable to assume knowledge about the scene
* topology (i.e. how springs and points are connected).

* This function is called every time step of the dynamic simulation.

* of the mass points of the 2D scene. The selected solver is passed
* to the function as well as the time step, the spings, and the
