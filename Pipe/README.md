# Final Project
The code compiles with the included makefile.

Blocks can be created by simply clicking on the grid.
Unfortunately, the resolution of the grid must be changed at compile time.

The 'p' key toggles the pressure visualization and the 's' key toggles the (very experimental) velocity scaling.
